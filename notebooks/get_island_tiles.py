"""Not directly involved in the other tools.
Count the number of tiles per island.
This is a good starting point for scoring.


But the values are inaccurate for multiple reasons:
    1) AreaIDs contains all tiles that can ever be built on.
    2) Water mostly matches where water is, but occasionally a tile is not marked as water,
       despite being underwater. It behaves like a water tile, so apparently the game uses
       the heightmap for water/nonwater calculations anyway.
       The heightmap has 4 numbers for each tile though and it would require testing to understand the calculations.
    3) Coast tiles are nonwater tiles that only support very few building types.
       The game does not explicitly store these tiles.
       Coasts are given as Bezier curves and these are converted to tiles during the loading screen.
       If the calculations were just implemented in a straightforward manner, that would not even be an issue.
       But the game rounds these numbers up and down and to .5 values which makes it hard to simulate this.
    4) Not even all water tiles are guaranteed to be reachable.
       The coast tiles actually define our reach into the water areas.
       No coast = no water tiles.

So I just modded the assets.xml and templates.xml to build quays across entire islands (needs 150 workers to unlock).
In contrast to ornaments these quays are not limited to ~1000 tiles per placement.

Instead, this script here just retrieves the number of river tiles,
so we can subtract them from islands without rivers (which were retrieved ingame).
